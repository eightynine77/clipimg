# clipimg
view copied images from clipboard with irfanview or mspaint

# guide
download either [clipimg irfanview](https://github.com/eightynine77/clipimg/tree/main/clipimg-irfanview) (if you have Irfanview installed) 

### or
download [clipimg mspaint](https://github.com/eightynine77/clipimg/tree/main/clipimg-mspaint-version) if you don't have irfanview installed (this uses mspaint)

# how to use
you can run [run_clipimg.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/clipimg/blob/main/run_clipimg.bat) to run clipimg as a windows system tray icon which is more convinient since you can easily run clipimg that way by simply clicking the system tray icon.  
OR you can manually run clipimg by running the batch file associated with the clipimg.ps1 scripts such as [run.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/clipimg/blob/main/clipimg-irfanview/run.bat) for clipimg irfanview and [run.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/clipimg/blob/main/clipimg-mspaint-version/run.bat) for clipimg mspaint version
